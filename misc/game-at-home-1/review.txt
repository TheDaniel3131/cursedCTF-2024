Song 1: ████████████████ review

Very good opening to start us off. I like how ████ is finally doing █████████████ again
and it sounds better than ever. It's not too energetic, but it's also not putting me to
sleep either. And of course the classic ██████████ make their appearance here as well.
Overall, 8/10.
